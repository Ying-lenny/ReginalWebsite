        Reginald’s Tower is Waterford’s landmark monument and Ireland’s oldest civic building. It has been in continuous use for over 800 years.  The first tower on the site was built by Vikings after 914 and formed the apex of the triangular settlement, an area known to this day as the Viking Triangle.  Re-built by the Anglo Normans in the 12th century the top two floors were added in the 15th century.  Until about 1700 the tower was the strongpoint of the medieval defensive walls that enclosed the city. The tower now houses an exhibition on Viking Waterford and is managed by the Office of Public Works.

        In 1861, Reginald's Tower became the property of the Waterford Corporation,[10] and the residence of the Chief Constable of Waterford. It continued to be inhabited until 1954, when the last resident left and the building was turned into a museum. During the Emergency it functioned as an air raid shelter.[12] It currently houses the Waterford Viking Museum and exhibits many of the archaeological finds from the 2003 dig at Woodstown on the River Suir near the city.[11]
        It is located in the area of Waterford Viking Triangle in the centre of Waterford city. A replica Viking longship is exhibited beside Reginald's Tower.
